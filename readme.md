## Description

UofT + is a Chrome extension designed to enhance the experience of students at the University of Toronto. It provides immediate access to past course averages from previous semesters, aiding students in making informed decisions about their course selections.

When a user is browsing courses on the university's course website, UofT + automatically extracts the course code and utilizes a comprehensive JSON file containing historical course data. This allows the extension to display a list of past course averages, offering valuable insights into the course's academic trends.

The information is presented in a user-friendly and visually appealing interface, making it easy for students to understand and compare course averages over time.
